In order to use autotest-growl, install either the comprehensive 
ZenTest gem or the lightweight autotest-standalone gem and then add the 
following line to your ~/.autotest file:

require 'autotest/growl'

Make sure the notification service installed on your computer:

http://growl.info (Growl for Mac OS X)
http://growlforwindows.com (Growl for Windows)
http://www.galago-project.org (libnotify for Linux)

If Growl notifications are not always displayed, take a look at the README
for assistance.
